                Speakeasy is a mobile app on iOS and android that allows users to communicate solely through audio. It is designed as a way to talk with your friends and family without the need for text or email. </p>
            <p className='read-me-header'>Purpose</p>
            <p className='read-me-text'>
                Speakeasy has a very simple purpose: Have fun talking with your friends again! So many times when you are texting you lose the elements of tone and intonation in the voice and you lose a sense of really talking to your friend as it is just text on a screen. However, Speakeasy allows you to have fun again by allowing for all sorts of vocal effects when talking to your friends. Use pitch bending, reverse, or more to elevate the conversation and have fun again.

            <p className='read-me-header'>Features</p>
            <p className='read-me-text'>
                The app is still in its early stages, but by the end of development we plan to have pitch bending, reverse, clipping certain portions of audio and replying to it, remixing, ability to save audio clips to the chat for later, and more.
